### Koch Curve

A Fractal is geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. Koch Curve (also known as the **Koch snowflake**) is a mathematical fractal curve constructed recursively using an equilateral triangle (See figure). The progression for the area of the snowflake converges to 1.6 times the area of the original triangle, while the progression for the snowflake's perimeter diverges to infinity. Consequently, the snowflake has a finite area bounded by an infinitely long line. **[more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake)**

This program traces out a 4 level Koch curve.
